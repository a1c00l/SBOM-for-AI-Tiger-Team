## Overview
The AIBOM TT (Artificial Intelligence Bill of Materials) (Tiger Team) is a collaborative group focused on exploring, defining, and operationalizing the concept of AIBOMs. Our mission is to promote industry-wide and enhance transparency, security and risk management for AI through the development of AIBOM best practices.

- **Expect change and need to adapt:** Stay flexible to new developments.
- **Not advising USG:** This team does not set government policy.
