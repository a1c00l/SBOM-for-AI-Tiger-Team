## What Problems We Are Trying to Address With AIBOM Tiger Team Working Group?
Identified problems with current AI systems that could be addressed by AIBOM (or with the help of AIBOM). This list might be updated as we evolve.

| Challenge                                            | Description                                                                                                                               | AIBOM relevance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Lack of Standardized Versioning Control               | Standardized versioning control makes it difficult to identify changes in models and datasets. How can we ensure the versioning of models and datasets is consistent and traceable?                         | Ideally, all models and datasets should be versioned. If that common standard for versioning is established, then AIBOM could include versioning information. Versions, indicating changes in datasets, model parameters, and configurations, would enable downstream systems to provide traceability and consistency. Each version could be also documented with specific metadata.<br><br>Challenge: There is no common standard for versioning of models and datasets (but there are blogs and recommendations); there could be some work-arounds if no version is defined (e.g., commit ref).<br><br>Open question: Should SBOM standards outline the necessary versioning field expectation that models and datasets should have in order to generate a complete AIBOM? This could enforce the versioning across the industry. |
| Ensuring Model Accuracy and Handling Model Drift     | Ensuring the accuracy of training results and addressing model drift. How do we collect and verify data to maintain model accuracy over time? | Fundamentally, this means AIBOM needs to be regularly updated to collect relevant data. For example, during or at the end of the training iteration, AIBOM would collect information about datasets (with its version reference), metrics, and other details. Then later, during the monitoring of AI system, a periodically generated AIBOM could collect data from the runtime system such as decision threshold, and possibly, other data which could identify model drift.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Handling Dynamic and Evolving Data                   | Managing accuracy and handling dynamic, evolving data in AI systems. How do we ensure data integrity and accuracy as datasets change?       | This is related to the challenge with versioning and model accuracy. Datasets should be versioned, and provenance data collected. AIBOM would need to be generated with every dataset change to reflect the latest information and provide traceability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Inadequate Classification and Provenance of Dataset Quality | Classifying dataset sources and quality within AIBOMs is inconsistent. What standards should be used to ensure datasets are appropriately classified and trustworthy? | Including provenance data can help trace the origin and transformations of datasets used in training. Similarly to versioning challenge, AIBOM could enforce standardized fields for dataset classification, source verification, and quality metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Managing Model Weights and Transparency              | Handling the weights within models is complex and often lacks transparency. How can we make the management of model weights more transparent and secure? | Model weights contribute to change management of the model. A snapshot of the model should be taken before and after the training to identify changes in the model weights.<br><br>Open question: can this data be collected from gradients?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Unclear Consumer Information Requirements            | Identifying the information required by consumers about AI in software is challenging. What specific fields and data should be included to meet consumers' needs? | Use cases with AIBOM should identify the need from the consumer side. This could drive the minimum AIBOM fields list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Understanding AI Decision Making                     | Understanding how AI decisions are made is often opaque. What information is needed to make AI decision processes transparent and understandable? | AIBOM could document decision threshold as part of the model training process. Further investigation is needed on the generation of data about decision logic programmatically into AIBOM data. Transparency for decisions is needed but documenting the logic of the model decision into an SBOM can raise IP rights concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Defining Appropriate AI Use Cases                    | Determining appropriate and inappropriate use cases for AI systems. What criteria should be used to define the boundaries of AI application? | Not all AI-related use cases will be relevant for an AIBOM. However, there will be use cases on AIBOM usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Managing Privacy Risks in Dataset Training           | Managing the risk related to the privacy of datasets used for training models. How can privacy be maintained while using comprehensive datasets? | AIBOM can contain information about datasets, such as whether it has PII. In order to collect this info, datasets should be classified. The maintenance of privacy is not the purpose of AIBOM, but it could shed some light if certain datasets used for training had personal information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Necessary Information for AIBOM                      | Identifying necessary information to include in the AIBOM. What specific data points are essential for a complete and useful AIBOM?           | Use cases with AIBOM should identify the need from the consumer side. This could drive the minimum AIBOM fields list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Common Language for AI Risk                          | Developing a common language for suppliers and customers to communicate AI risks. How can we standardize terminology to ensure clear communication? | Definitions of AI risks are not handled through AIBOM, but AIBOM could enforce through SBOM standards to collect necessary info about AI systems, which could also somewhat create a common risk language. Standardizing risk language terminology should be handled as a separate workstream (from AIBOM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Managing Risks of Open Source Models and Third-Party AI | How security teams manage the risk of open-source models and datasets is unclear. What strategies can be implemented to mitigate these risks effectively? Managing risk in AI-enabled software purchased from third parties. How can third-party risks be assessed and mitigated? | AIBOM can document the origin, dependencies, and security assessments of open-source and third-party AI models, helping manage and mitigate associated risks.<br><br>Open question: how should AIBOM document a model cluster and prompt dependencies? Example: model A has a dependency on model B; the initial request is routed to model B, which feeds its prompt into model A, and model A provides the end results.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Creating and Maintaining AI/ML Inventory             | Creating an inventory of AI/ML models, datasets, etc. is complex. What methods can be used to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory? | AIBOM is not an inventory but an artifact that can supply necessary data to the downstream system to present an inventory. In order to have an accurate inventory, AIBOM should document all the components of the AI system (e.g., models used and dependencies, datasets, and other details). It's not AIBOM's scope to define methods for downstream systems. However, use cases of AIBOM should help define the necessary information for accurate inventory systems.                                                                                                                |
| Incident Response for ML Issues                      | Performing incident response for ML-related issues and understanding business impacts. How can incident response processes be tailored to address ML-specific challenges? | Incident response of AI/ML is not handled by AIBOM. Vulnerabilities in AI software can be found through traditional SBOM component breakdown (vulnerable libraries). Outside of the AIBOM workstream, further research needs to be done to have a specific definition of ML vulnerability (e.g., is a jailbreak that allows creating ransomware a vulnerability?).                                                                                                                                                               |
| Understanding and Communicating Model Changes        | Defining what it means when models have been changed. How can changes be tracked and communicated effectively?                             | AIBOM should contain information about models and datasets, and changes to any of those should indicate a change. This is also related to the versioning challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Depth of ML Component Analysis                       | Determining the extent of analysis required for ML components, e.g., feature engineering. How deep should the analysis go to be effective without being overly complex? | It makes sense to document in AIBOM model dependency information. AIBOM should not document logic of application (e.g., feature) as this could have IP rights concerns. Related: decision transparency challenge.<br><br>Open question: how should AIBOM document a model cluster and prompt dependencies? Example: model A has a dependency on model B; the initial request is routed to model B, which feeds its prompt into model A, and model A provides the end results.                                                                                                        |
| Defining Characteristics of an AI System             | Identifying what constitutes an AI system vs traditional software. What are the defining characteristics of an AI system, and how do they differ from traditional software? | It makes sense to outline this as part of AIBOM use cases to scope the generation of AIBOM information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
