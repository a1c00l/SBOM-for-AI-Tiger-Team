# Appendix A â€“ SBOM for AI Glossary and Terminology

The SBOM for AI Use Cases White Paper is intended for readers from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. To ensure clarity and consistency, this glossary defines key terms that may have varying interpretations across different fields, providing a common reference point for understanding SBOM for AI concepts.

For general cybersecurity terms, readers should consult established references such as NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5; this glossary does not attempt to redefine well-established cybersecurity terminology.
