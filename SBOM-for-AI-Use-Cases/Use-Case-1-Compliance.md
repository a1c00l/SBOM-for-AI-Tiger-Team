# Use Case 1: Compliance

## 🧩 Problem Statement

AI systems are complex, dynamic, and often opaque. Regulators, auditors, and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding greater transparency into how AI models are built, trained, and maintained.

Compliance with SBOM and AI-specific regulations—such as:
- Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
- EU AI Act
- U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance
- Industry-specific guidelines (e.g., HHS ONC HTI-1 for healthcare)

—requires a clear, traceable record of every component used throughout AI development and deployment.

Without a comprehensive **SBOM for AI**, organizations face several challenges:

- **Limited Transparency** – Difficulty tracking the origin, purpose, and dependencies of AI components used in production systems.  
- **Compliance Gaps** – Inability to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements related to accountability, explainability, and fairness.  
- **Audit Complexity** – Responding to audits becomes a manual and time-consuming task due to the lack of structured AI documentation.  
- **Regulatory Risk** – Non-compliance can lead to legal penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions.  
- **Manual Overhead** – Tracing AI system components without automation consumes significant resources and expertise.

## ✅ Benefits

An **SBOM for AI** provides a structured, machine-readable inventory of AI components—enabling compliance, auditability, and operational control.

### Key Benefits Include:

- **Compliance Assurance** – Demonstrates adherence to traceability, fairness, and transparency requirements across evolving regulatory frameworks.  
- **Streamlined Audits** – Reduces time, effort, and cost in responding to regulatory and internal audits.  
- **Improved Risk Management** – Helps identify non-compliant or unauthorized components before they enter production.  
- **Efficiency Gains** – Supports automation of documentation, monitoring, and reporting workflows.  
- **Trust and Accountability** – Builds confidence with regulators, partners, and customers through clear, verifiable records of AI system components.

## 💡 Example Scenario

### Scenario: Ensuring Compliance for AI-Enabled Medical Wearable Devices

A medical technology company develops an AI-powered wearable device that monitors heart activity to detect early signs of arrhythmia. This device is classified as a medical device by the **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** and must comply with the agency’s guidelines on software safety, efficacy, and security.

#### 🔍 Software Validation and Verification

FDA regulations require rigorous validation and verification of software used in medical devices. By using an SBOM for AI, the company can document every software component, library, and model used in the device’s AI system.

#### 📄 Regulatory Submissions and Documentation

For FDA approval, the company must submit comprehensive documentation, including:
- AI algorithm details
- Software architecture for each component

While an SBOM for AI does not replace regulatory documentation, it **supports** it by providing:
- A **machine-readable inventory** of components
- Clear traceability
- Visibility into dependencies and provenance

This aids in meeting requirements under FDA’s **Premarket Approval (PMA)** or **510(k)** pathways.

#### 🔁 Post-Market Surveillance and Updates

FDA mandates ongoing monitoring and software updates post-launch.  
If an update is needed (e.g., to improve algorithm performance or patch a vulnerability), the **SBOM for AI** ensures:
- Documented changes
- Continued compliance with FDA rules

#### 🤝 Third-Party Vendor Compliance

The device uses third-party AI components and libraries.
