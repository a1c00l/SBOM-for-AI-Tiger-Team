## What Problems We Are Trying to Address With AIBOM Tiger Team Working Group?
Identified problems with current AI systems that could be addressed by AIBOM (or with the help of AIBOM). This list might be updated as we evolve.

| **Problem Statement**                         | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Standardized Versioning Control       | Standardized versioning control makes it difficult to identify changes in models and datasets. How can we ensure the versioning of models and data sets is consistent and traceable? What defineds a change in AI system? (e.g., changes that did not resut from the code updates but rather new data set or else) |
| Difficulty in Ensuring Model Accuracy         | Ensuring the accuracy of training results and addressing model drift. How do we collect and verify data to maintain model accuracy over time? |
| Inadequate Classification of Dataset Quality  | Classifying dataset sources and quality within AIBOMs is inconsistent. What standards should be used to ensure datasets are appropriately classified and trustworthy? |
| Managing Model Weights                        | Handling the weights within models is complex and often lacks transparency. How can we make the management of model weights more transparent and secure? |
| Unclear Consumer Information Requirements     | Identifying the information required by consummers about AI in software is challenging. What specific fields and data should be included to meet consumers' needs? |
| Handling Dynamic Data                         | Managing accuracy and handling dynamic, evolving data in AI systems. How do we ensure data integrity and accuracy as datasets change? |
| Understanding AI Decision Making              | Understanding how AI decisions are made is often opaque. What information is needed to make AI decision processes transparent and understandable? |
| Defining AI Use Cases                         | Determining appropriate and inappropriate use cases for AI systems. What criteria should be used to define the boundaries of AI application? |
| Privacy Risks in Dataset Training             | Managing the risk related to the privacy of datasets used for training models. How can privacy be maintained while using comprehensive datasets? |
| Necessary Information for AIBOM               | Identifying necessary information to include in the AIBOM. What specific data points are essential for a complete and useful AIBOM? |
| Common Language for AI Risk                   | Developing a common language for suppliers and customers to communicate AI risks. How can we standardize terminology to ensure clear communication? |
| Managing Open Source Model Risks              | How security teams manage the risk of open source models and datasets is unclear. What strategies can be implemented to mitigate these risks effectively? |
| Third-Party AI Risk                           | Managing risk in AI-enabled software purchased from third parties. How can third-party risks be assessed and mitigated? |
| AI/ML Inventory Challenges                    | Creating an inventory of AI/ML models, datasets, etc. is complex. What methods can be used to maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory? |
| Incident Response for ML Issues               | Performing incident response for ML-related issues and understanding business impacts. How can incident response processes be tailored to address ML-specific challenges? |
| Understanding Model Changes                   | Defining what it means when models have been changed. How can changes be tracked and communicated effectively? |
| Depth of ML Component Analysis                | Determining the extent of analysis required for ML components, e.g., feature engineering. How deep should the analysis go to be effective without being overly complex? |
| Defining an AI System                         | Identifying what constitutes an AI system vs traditional software. What are the defining characteristics of an AI system, and how do they differ from traditional software? |
